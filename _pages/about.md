I am Postdoctoral Scholar working with [Prof. Stavros G. Vougioukas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/) at Bio-Automation Lab, University of California, Davis. My current research focuses on the development of data-driven approaches for human activity recognition and precision yield monitoring in strawberry fields.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biological and Agricultural Engineering at Washington State University (WSU) under [Prof. Manoj Karkee](https://labs.wsu.edu/karkee-ag-robotics/). During my Ph.D., I worked on the development of deep learning-based weakly/fully supervised computer vision algorithms for object detection, segmentation, density estimation, localization, counting; development of ground-based robotic systems for field operations such as blossom thinning, pruning, pollination in orchards, and green shoot thinning in vineyards; as well as development of aerial robotic systems for pest bird deterrence in vineyards.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
