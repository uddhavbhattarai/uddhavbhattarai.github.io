I am a researcher specializing in computer vision, artificial intelligence, and robotics, with experience developing intelligent systems for automation, perception, and data-driven decision-making. My work spans the development and implementation of fully, weakly, and semi supervised deep learning algorithms for object detection, segmentation, localization, human activity recognition, and sensor fusion, as well as development and testing of integrated robotic systems in real-world environment in agriculture.

Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Scholar with [Prof. Stavros G. Vougioukas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/) at Bio-Automation Lab, University of California, Davis. My current research focuses on the development of low cost, scalable, and practicle AI-based solutions for human activity recognition, efficiency evaluation, and precision monitoring in complex environments.

I completed my Ph.D. at Washington State University (WSU) under [Prof. Manoj Karkee](https://agrobotics.cals.cornell.edu/) (now at Cornell University). During my Ph.D., I worked in the intersection of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and ground/aerial robotics for automation and enhanced decision-making in dynamic, unstructured environment. My doctoral research focused on the design, development, and deployment of intelligent robotic systems, including algorithms for scene understanding (object detection, segmentation, localization, density estimation, counting) and advanced control systems.
