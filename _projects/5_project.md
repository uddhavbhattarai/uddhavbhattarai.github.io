Our team modified picking carts during strawberry harvesting by instrumenting them with load cells to measure weight, Global Positioning System (GPS) to locate carts, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to measure cart motion.

For picker activity recognition, a deep neural network based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) was developed to classify timeseries data into "Pick" and "NoPick". Input data from sensors involved mass, latutude, longitude, ax, ay, az.

Mass, acceleration, and velocity data were annotated and utilized to tran the network.

Furthermore, the time series data, including weight, geo-location, velocity, and acceleration, were fed to a novel yield estimation software pipeline that involved multiple stages of data processing and conditioning algorithms that generate harvested day yield maps. These yield maps were then integrated to create a desired resolution yield map (e.g., 1.2 m x 1.2 m grid) for the entire harvesting season. Preliminary evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved 85.1% accuracy (Pearson r = 0.94) in estimating the total harvested tray count when compared with the growerâ€™s records used to compensate the pickers.
