Similar to blossom thinning system, the Robotic Pollination System consisted of machine vision system (Intel RealSense D435i) integrated with mechatronic system involving UR5e 6-degrees of freedom robotic manipulator and end-effector. The end-effector system consisted electrostatic sprayer system to spray pollen solutions to target flower clusters.

Apple canopy branches were netted weeks prior to blooming. Nets were removed during experiement trial followed by re-netting to prevent post pollination via natural pollination.

The initial field trial results were encouraging. However, fruit set differed between apple varieties and was generally lower compared to natural pollination. The quality of the fruits from robotic pollination was similar to fruits from natural pollination. System needs further development to enhance pollen solution (the mixture containing pollen grains) development and application, as well as to ensure the effectiveness of the robotic pollination in different fruit variety.
